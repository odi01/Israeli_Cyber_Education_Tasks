# Cyber Education Tasks
Tasks that I chose to represent from the Israeli Cyber Education Python Course (Self.py & Next.py).

## 1 - Hangman Game (Basic Python)
### A simple hangman game that applies all the basics of Python into a functional game.
The secret word is imported from a words.txt file that contains a bunch of words and each time chooses a secret word based on index input.
The secret word shown in _ _ _ format and the user got seven tries until failure. 

I've taken this game one step further and took care about extreme cases when the program might fail.

## 2 - Zoo Class Structure (OOP)
### Using Object-Oriented Programming which uses a Zoo example to code an inherent class from each other.
This task shows how to inherit a class from a different class and also how to create a new method except the class which we inherit from.
Each animal in the zoo has specific attributes and methods but all of them inherit the same attributes from the main "Animal" class.

## 3 - ID Number Genrator
### Using advance concepest in Python such as OOP, Genrators, Iterators, One-Liners, Map, etc... to programing a valid Israeli ID number genrator.
In this program I created a custom made Exception to handle errors betters. Also, took advantage of Genrator and Iterators to sepreate specific taks to get the job done.
