# Israeli Cyber Education Python Course
Tasks that I chose to represent from the Israeli Cyber Education Python Course (Self.py & Next.py).

## 1 - Hangman Game (Basic Python)
### A simple hangman game that applies all the basics of Python into a functional game.
The player chooses a secret word by it's index from a words.txt file that contains a bunch of words. The secret word is shown in _ _ _ format and the player has seven guesses until failure. I took this game one step further and handled extreme cases when the program might fail.

## 2 - Zoo Class Structure (OOP)
### Using Object-Oriented Programming to create a virtual Zoo to implement the usage of class inheritance.
Created a based Animal class which all other classes are inherit from. Each animal has unique attributes in addition to the Animal class.

## 3 - ID Number Generator (Advance)
### Using advanced concepts in Python such as OOP, Generators, Iterators, One-Liners, Map, etc... to program an Israeli ID number generator based on user date of birth.
This program uses a real ID algorithm to generate valid ID numbers and all of their valid followings based on the user date of birth. Also, taking advantage of Generators and Iterators to separate specific tasks to make the code more readable and use custom made Exceptions to handle errors better.
